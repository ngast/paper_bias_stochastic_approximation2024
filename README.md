# Computing the Bias of Constant-step Stochastic Approximation with Markovian Noise

This repository contains all the code to reproduce the paper "Computing the Bias of Constant-step Stochastic Approximation with Markovian Noise", accepted at NeurIPS 2024. This include the code to run the simulations, to produce the figures and the pdf of the paper.

To produce the figures:
- `cd simu` and execute the two jupyter notebooks

To produce the paper:
- just compile the file `stochastic-approximation-bias.tex`
